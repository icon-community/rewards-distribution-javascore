# rewards distribution javascore

This repository contains the code for the rewards distribution smart contract (source code) and the scripts for deploying the contract.

The smart contract allows for the distribution of rewards to a list of addresses.

A list of admins can be defined and used to add the users and their rewards. By the default the contract owner is an admin and only the contract owner can add other admins.
